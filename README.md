# Knowledge-Graph Powered AI Mentor for Adaptive Coding Support

## Overview

This project is a personalized coding support platform that combines graph-based learning models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver tailored guidance for developers. It leverages Neo4j for tracking learning progress and concept dependencies, and integrates advanced AI models to generate context-aware explanations, code help, and system design support.

The platform adapts to each individual's cognitive patterns and knowledge gaps, offering an intelligent, structured, and practical approach to mastering technical concepts.
